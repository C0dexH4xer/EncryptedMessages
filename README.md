# EncryptedMessages
I have made this cipther tool for fun, but you can add an ID that is so large that  it'll be basically impossible to decrypt unless the other part has that same exact ID that you used to encrypt with.


Let's say you have this message: "Hello how are you doing today?" but you want nobody to know what that message includes except the other part you are going to send it to, then you can write any
Range-ID that you'd like. So let's just say for fun a Range-ID of "999999999999999999" then that is the key to decrypt the message which you would want to give to the other part who has to know about
this encrypted message that YOU are sending. (This can also be reverse so not just you sending to another part, but the part can send to you also).

There is a help commandline in there. To see what you can do just write "help" when in the prompt.

Pro tip: You need python for this to work✌️
